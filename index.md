# About me

My main research interest is to understand the effects of anthropogenic activities on terrestrial vertebrate populations, to improve their conservation in the present and future. 

Mainly, I study species habitat use and distribution, interspecies interactions and spatial and temporal dynamics, predicting population responses to environmental change and human disturbance. In my research, I confront empirical data with ecological theory, using a modelling approach which allows me to explore mechanistic relationships and further understand wildlife responses at population and community levels. Thus, my research toolbox expans from (joint-) Species Distribution Models to Connectivity Analysis and Spatially-explicit Agent Based Models (se-ABM), as well as analysis of telemetry and GIS data.

Although I have worked with many different taxa, from gut microbes to diurnal raptors, my true love are large carnivores, specially grey wolf and Eurasian lynx. Regarding the former, a big part of my recent research activities have focused on understanding wolf recolonization of Central Europe (distribution and range expansion, demography) and predicting population development in the near future under different scenarios (population viability analysis, se-ABM) to establish critical thresholds for species conservation. Regarding the lynx, I am currently involved in the Eurolynx network, collaborating in several pagers and leading the analysis of individual behavioural responses to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance across Europe.

I believe that a deeper undertanding of the interplay of population dynamics, species interactions and environmental effects will definitely lead to better conservation actions and open new doors for coexistence between humans and large carnivores.
