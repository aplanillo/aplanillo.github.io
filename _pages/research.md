## Research lines and projects 


### Population Ecology and Dynamics

* Demography, Population Viability Analysis (PVA), Behaviour analysis, Habitat use

Population dynamics refers to the study of changes in population size, structure, and distribution over time, along with the factors that drive these changes. This field examines how birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration affect population growth and stability, and it’s foundational for understanding species survival and persistence. For large carnivores, population dynamics research is particularly important in informing conservation and management strategies.

***Projects***

* Scientific derivation of the Minimum Viable Population for the species wolf (Annex IV Habitats Directive) by means of demographic-genetic PVA as a basis for deriving the
reference value for the favorable total population (2022-2023). Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Bundesamt für Naturschutz, BfN) within the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) (FKZ: 3521831300). *PI: Stephanie Kramer-Schadt. Co-PI: Aimara Planillo*
* Eurolynx Pager (2020-ongoing): Effects of human disturbance on lynx activity patterns at the European scale. *Lead: Aimara Planillo*


### Spatial Patterns and Movement Ecology

* Connectivity, Species Distributions, Step Selection Function

The way that vertebrates move through and occupy space is afected by environmental conditions and individuals characteristics. The interplay of both determine aspects as relevantas  habitat connectivity and species distribution. Furthermore, the movement of an individual changes across its live time, depending on its life status (juvenile, dispersing, breeding), making this topic a highly dynamic approach.

***Projects***

* NaturaConnect (joint on 2024-ongoing): Building a resilient ecological network of conserved areas across Europe for nature and people (Horizon Europe, ID 101060429). *Participant in WP6 and WP8*
* Habitat selection and suitability for wolves in Germany (2020-2022). ‘Federal Documentation and Consultation Centre on Wolves’ (FKZ 3515 82 4100). *Participant*


### Human Disturbance and Urban Ecology

* Urban ecology, road ecology, anthropogenic impacts 
    
While urban and road ecology share many characteristics of more general ecology fields, they also present very specific challenges. They are novel ecosystems with unique risks and resources trade-offs and, therefore, they provide new habitats to vertebrate species, which need to adapt their activity patterns, resource allocation and spatial or temporal niches. Furthermore, the apparent overabundance of resources may create ecological traps for some species or modify the interactions in the community.
