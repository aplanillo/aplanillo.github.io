Under construction...
* | Wolf recolonization of Central Europe | ![image-right](/assets/images/wolf-image.jpg){: .align-right width="50%"} |
* Lynx activity analysis and human disturbance levels

## Spatial ecology
Under construction...
* European connectivity

## Urban ecology
Under construction...
* Breeding bird community in urban area: species distributions and interactions
* Nightingale distribution: citizen science
* Mesocarnivore community in berlin: spatial and temporal niche segretations

## Road ecology
Under construction...

* Raptor community response to roads and motorways
* Rabbit responses to roads
